# Bootstrap 5 - Login/Signup

This is a simple Bootstrap 5 login and signup page example.
You can use this as a Template for Login/Signup into your Website/Application/Software.

This project has 2 html files. One for the Login and a second file for signup.
All the Css styling is located in assets/css.
In the assets/img folder you can put in your own Logo.


## Style usage:

I have created two css styles for a light- and a dark-theme example.
You can use the following code below to use normal or dark theme.
Of course you can change all the colors to your own color theming.

### Light-Theme:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">
```

### Dark-Theme:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style_dark.css">
```
